\section{Motivation}

\begin{frame}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Lacking internet infrastructure in disaster zones
        \item Censorship restricts Self-organized, egalitarian and democratic communication
        \item Keep schedule for children despite chaos
        \item Provide a way to communicate with loved ones
    \end{itemize}
